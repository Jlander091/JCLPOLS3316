##Causal Inference and Hypothesis Testing

### Where we were 

+ Standard Errors - distance between sample and population data
+ Z-scores - probability that sample represents the true population data

                + We actually take the Z-score to a table to translate it into a probability 
                
### Today - Look at Z-tables / Talk about statistics and causal inference

$$\\[5in]$$
### Statistics: Cause and effect

+ What is a cause?

+ Causes are complicated!

+ The Fundamental Problem

+ Hypothesis Testing

+ So what does a hypothesis test tell us?

+ That Bayes Rule Thing Again

$$\\[5in]$$

+ What is a cause?


$$\\[6in]$$
# A cause is the thing that Y wouldn't happen without

# If X didn't exist, Y wouldn't happen

# Except

$$\\[6in]$$


+ Causes are complicated!

+ Causes are complicated!

        + Multiple causes (non-rival)
        + Causes may be necessary but not sufficient (conditional)
        + Causes may be sufficient but not necessary
        + Some causes may be neither
        + The randomness factor (stochastic factor)
        + Causes can have feedbacks or intermediate steps (mediating variables or effects)
        + These are actually the "easy problems"
        

$$\\[6in]$$

+ The Fundamental Problem

$$\\[6in]$$

        + We can't observe the "what if"?
        + The technical term for the "what if?" is the **counterfactual**
        + We don't know if Y would have happened without X because X happened
        + This is a huge problem for observational studies, it's still a problem for experiments
        + Experiments can solve the problem by designing how the data is generated
        + Observational studies ultimately rely on our treatment of the data

$$\\[6in]$$

+ Hypothesis Testing

$$\\[6in]$$
+ Hypothesis Testing

        + The null hypothesis ~ any effect on Y is due to random chance
        + Null hypothesis is *as if* X didn't exist, only random chance
        + We want to design our hypothesis and model so that the null hypothesis ~ the counterfactual
        + That's aspirational

$$\\[6in]$$

        + It may tell us "the null hypothesis is retained" - The Theory is Wrong

        + What if "null is rejected?" - Does that mean **The Theory is Right**?

<p style="color:green;text-align:center;font-size: 40px;">The evidence is consistent with the hypothesis.</p>  

<p style="color:green;text-align:center;font-size: 40px;">The null hypothesis is rejected and the evidence is consistent with the hypothesized effect.</p>  

<p style="color:blue;text-align:center;font-size: 40px;">What about certainty and proof?</p>

# This way madness lies 
# Everything after here is draft notes for your reading. Beware of typos, etc.

Some of the things in these notes are from courses I took, some are from assorted books, some are from these two sources which are at least somewhat readable and free:

+ We need to understand what statistics can tell us about causation
+ Correlation doesn't prove causation but that doesn't mean statistics can't help
+ We need to be precise about what we mean by a cause
+ We need to understand the limits of data and statistics
+ We need to understand the capabilities of data and statistics

$$\\[5in]$$

### What do we know about causation?

1. Correlation $\notequal$ causation. 

                + Correlation does imply a relationship that may involve some cause and effect somewhere.
                + The relationship could go either direction
                + The relationship could involve other variables
                + Lack of correlation doesn't necessarily mean anything -- correlation is linear and causal effects aren't always linear


2. A cause is a claim about something that didn't happen.

                + If we say X caused Y, we mean: *If X didn't happen, Y would not happen, everything else being held the same.*
                
3. **The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference**

                + Our proposed cause, which did happen, is the factual
                + The thing that didn't happen is called the *counterfactual*
                + We can't actually observe the thing that didn't happen
                + The inability to observe the counterfactual is the fundamental problem of causal inference
                + Experiments are a potential way around this

4. Causes have to involve a possible manipulation of circumstances so that the counterfactual occurred

5. Statistics looks for average causal effects, not single data points or individual effects. The average effects may conflict with anecdotal evidence. This is partially because...
                
6. There can be multiple causes. (Causes are non-rival.)

7. Causes can be necessary, sufficient, neither, or both and still be causes. 

8. It's a lot easier to measure effects than to find causes.


### What can statistics do for us?

+ The Null Hypothesis and counterfactuals

                + We can measure the probability an effect is due to random chance (the null hypothesis)
                + Formal hypothesis tests give us this value, the *p-value*
                + Theory provides an *alternative hypothesis* which we believe to be true based on the theory
                + Well designed hypotheses can help with the unobserved counterfactual
                + When we reject the null, we can determine that "the evidence is consistent with the alternative hypothesis" and the theory
