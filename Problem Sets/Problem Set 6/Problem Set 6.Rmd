Using your project data set, or any built in R dataset if you are not doing the project, do the following:

1. Using your chosen y (dependent) variable and one of your chosen x (explanatory) variables, perform a simple OLS regression using R. Follow these steps:

  + define a model object using the lm() function
  + report the model statistics using the summary() function
  + produce a model table using the stargazer() function from the stargazer library with type = "text" (A demonstration of this using model2 in Tuesday's lab has been added to that code.)
  
2. Using the same variables, produce a scatterplot with an lm() line and 95% confidence interval. You may use the base r plot() function or the ggplot() function from Tuesday lab.
